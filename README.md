# sw-sync-cli

> [!WARNING]  
> This tool is experimental and for now just a prototype.

A CLI tool that communicates with the 
[Shopware admin API](https://shopware.stoplight.io/docs/admin-api)
(over an [integration](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/settings/system/integrationen?category=shopware-6-en/settings/system))
to export data into (CSV) files or import data from (CSV) files.

## Features

- It's fast, with a focus on performance
- Every entity and field available in the API can be exported / imported
- Import / Export profiles are just `.yaml` files
  - Which can be copied + adapted + shared freely
- Profiles include a scripting engine for arbitrary data transformations
- For now only supports CSV files
